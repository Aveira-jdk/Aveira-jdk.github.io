                <p>
                    In novel news, the Tokyo Game Show SAO Stage on September 27 unveiled that Sword Art Online Volume 25: Unital Ring IV is slated for December 10, 2020 release, while Sword Art Online Progressive volume 7 is preliminarily planned for release in Spring 2021. The cover for volume 25 and synopsis of volume 25 have been unveiled as of November 10, 2020 (November 9 in the West). On that note, the bonus content for the remaining Alicization War of Underworld anime Blu-Ray/DVDs has been announced. The final volume in the series will contain an original side story by the series's author Kawahara Reki. The side story is titled "If We Could Walk Together" and is the third installment in an alternative Alicization timeline series by the author, answering the question of what would have happened had Eugeo and Kirito never broken the Taboo Index and instead became Integrity Knights. The side story will be released on December 9, 2020. The volume will also contain the second original soundtrack volume for the Alicization War of Underworld anime.
                    Additionally, Sword Art Online Alicization Lycoris, the supposedly final game in the SAO game series, was released in Japan on July 9, 2020 (for the PlayStation consoles) and in the West on July 10, 2020. A livestream held on September 19, 2020 unveiled that the game actually had a secret true ending that only one person in the entire world managed to unlock. The secret ending also included an English version of the game's opening song, Scar/let, which was also released for purchase on September 19, 2020. As of Ver1.09 of the game, the true ending has become available for all players of the game without the secret unlock conditions. The game has also opened its microtransaction store for cosmetic items. Kirito's iconic swords from the entire series have also been added to the CUBE lineup.
                    On that note, a trailer on the game's upcoming free and DLC content was unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show 2020 on September 27, 2020. The event also unveiled plot teasers for the four-part free DLC. Each of the free DLC will focus on a different set of supporting characters.
